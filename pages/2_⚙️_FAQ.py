# inputText="""Diwali is the season to celebrate with joy and cheer. It was the day when king Rama destroyed the evil forces and reached home to a rousing welcome by his subjects. Diwali has long been associated with bursting crackers, which is not in the true spirits of the festival. The main motive of the festival is to spread happiness with your loved ones. Festivals have been made to reinforce strong bonds between families and friends, and Diwali is the best example. Everyone goes home for Diwali and celebrates it with their families. It is a national holiday, so everyone enjoys the festival without worrying about work. It gets more exciting at night because lots of sky-lanterns are released into the air that flies high and lights up the night sky. Diwali teaches us to be patient for good things in life. Children keep waiting for many days to enjoy that bite of their favourite sweet. The houses are thoroughly cleaned to clean them of dirt. Cleanliness is very important as it would determine your wellness and health. It has been a part of Hindu culture for a very long time and fosters the moral lesson of â€œGood people always win over bad ones."""
